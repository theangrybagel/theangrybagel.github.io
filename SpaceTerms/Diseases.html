        <p>Eldon Foot Fungus is a very treatable disease that comes from Eldons that are at an age of about 23,000 GY. It can be fatal if left untreated for more than 19-43 GY, and it is a common cause of death for Eldons who live on planets controlled by The Divine Oligarchy, since the Oligarchy outlawed complaints related to feet in 40075 AGF (this applies to Eldons only, and yes, the DO is racist.)</p>

        <p>Galaian Addiction Disorder is a common disorder amongst <a href='Races/Galaians.html'>Galians</a>, and it results in strange addictions to non addictive substances. One of the strangest cases of GAD was in 1354 AGF, when a patient had become severely addicted to Goop-Wazzer, a recently created space beverage which was known to be the worst beverage in the galaxy. Goop-Wazzer made 97% of their profit from this patient, and they were shut down due to bankruptcy in 1403 AGF when the patient died.</p>

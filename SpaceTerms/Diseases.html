        <p>Eldon Foot Fungus is a very treatable disease that comes from Eldons that are at an age of about 23,000 GY. It can be fatal if left untreated for more than 19-43 GY, and it is a common cause of death for Eldons who live on planets controlled by The Divine Oligarchy, since the Oligarchy outlawed complaints related to feet in 40075 AGF (this applies to Eldons only, and yes, the DO is racist.)</p>

        <p>Yolcorg, or, as it translates to your language, <i>"The Chicken Of Space"</i>, is a common feathery beast about the size of a common species' head, that has been exported to hundreds of planets around the galaxy. It is the first choice for farmers, for it produces eggs that can be cooked, or hatched in a <a href="Items/Tools.html#YIP">YIP</a>.</p>

    <div id="SpaceWhale">
        <h3 style='text-align: left;'>Spacewhale</h3>
        <p>Spacewhales are giant whale like creatures that can survive in space. They are extremely rare, some galactic scientists even consider them an endangered species. Spacewhales, in most cases, are between 15 NY and 20NY long, but they can grow to be up to 20 MY long (thats the size of a very small moon). </p>

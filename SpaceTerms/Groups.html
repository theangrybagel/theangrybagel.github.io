            <h2>Main Factions</h2>
    <div id="TGF">
        <h3 style='text-align: left;'>The Galactic Federation</h3>
        <p>The Galactic Federation controls most of the civilized part of the galaxy. This faction is responsible for most of the trends in the galaxy, for they funded new corporations and focused much of their attention towards improving the galactic economy when they became a faction. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="TDO">
        <h3 style='text-align: left;'>The Divine Oligarchy</h3>
        <p>The Divine Oligarchy is much like planet Earth's British Government combined with the USSR. Created in 478 BGF by Deacon Gantry I, Gantry decided to have several children (whilst drunk on a party ship), who were ordered to battle eachother to the death when Gantry was trying to determine who would take his place, for he had contracted EFF, and didn't know it was EFF, and left it untreated for 19 years. At this point it was at a fatal stage, and he had less than four weeks to live. His bastard sons agreed to fake eachothers deaths, and Deacon Gantry Jr Alpha-II staged himself as the winner. Finally, Deacon Gantry I died, and his children emerged from hiding. There were four of them, and they all had agreed to share the throne with equal power. Since then, there have been 4-27 rulers of the Divine Oligarchy ruling at once, each giving their power up to their (also bastard) offspring before their death. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="RP">
        <h3 style='text-align: left;'>Rebel Peasants</h3>
        <p>The Rebel Peasants departed from the Divine Oligarchy in 37 BGF because, according to their leader, "The Divine Oligarchy underpays their peasants". This militized group of peasants still fights the DO today, occasionally with the help of Matelon Terrorists. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="TT">
        <h3 style='text-align: left;'>The Torgians</h3>
        <p>The Torgians are a stubborn race, perhaps the stubbornest in the galaxy. Due to their stubborness, they refused to join any other faction, and instead they formed their own. The Torgians rarely lose any battle, which is why most other factions choose to stay away from them. They've slowed down their expansion a lot since 27742 AGF, although they currently control nearly 50% of the galaxy. </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Other Groups</h2>
        <div id="MT">
        <h3 style='text-align: left;'>Matelon Terrorists</h3>
        <p>Matelon Terrorists care about money and nothing else. All you have to do is give the group a few hundred thousand credits, give them an organization, and as long as you don't tell them to attack any Torgians, they'll terrorize that organization. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="MAP">
        <h3 style='text-align: left;'>MAP (The Massive Advertising Project)</h3>
        <p>Supposedly shut down by the Galactic Federation in 3998 AGF due to being "too influential", MAP successfully hacked millions of <a href="Items/Tools.html#LTD">LTDs</a> and placed advertisements in the dreams of LTD users (which was almost every single space person). Some people still get advertisments in their dreams, and there are conspiracies about the MAP still existing. The only problem with this is that if it were true, then almost every corporation would be breaking the law by paying MAP to advertise for them.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Corporations and Other Businesses</h2>
    <div id="STC">
        <h3 style='text-align: left;'>The See Through Company</h3>
        <p>The STC raised millions of credits for their company by convincing consumers that what they were paying for actually existed, only it was see-through. They sold things like see-through windows, see-through water, and eventually see-through spaceships. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="WarpFoods">
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Warp Food Restaurants</h3>
        <p>M<a style='color: red;'>cR</a>onalds - The most common restaurant in the entire galaxy, possibly the entire universe. In 14320 AGF, an unknown group of space people, possibly the Matelon Terrorists, went around and vandalized every single McRonalds sign, in the span of two space-days, making the C and the R stand out, likely to symbolize their overly expensive menu.<br>LFY - Linzioclite Fried Yolcorg is famous for it's Fried Yolcorg, which a person from Earth might describe as the chicken of space. It is the reason so many people live on <a href="SectorMap/Sector 71/KFP-48-Etis-FBF-11-Dainerth Delta II/Linzioclite Iota X/About.html">Linzioclite Iota X</a>.</p>

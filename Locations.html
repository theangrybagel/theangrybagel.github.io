            <div>
                <h3>Space Malls</h3>
                <p>Space malls are well-kept space stations full of shops and things. People often go to space malls seeking peace, since they are usually well guarded and secure. If you're running from a pack of Torgians, however, the space mall isn't the greatest place to hide out, since most authorities try to stay out of any Torgian's way and will not fight back against them.</p>

                <h3>Automines</h3>
                <p>Automines are giant mines that surround a planet, usually gas planets, like a space station, and collect materials from that planet. </p>

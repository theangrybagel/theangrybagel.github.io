They began to industrialize, and then the snow began to turn black. In 29679 AGF, scientists began to research the snow, only to realize that it was actually a substance comprised of very small lifeforms. These lifeforms are classified as "Snopolies". Further into their research, scientists discovered that snopolies change their color based on their mood. With all the industrialization, the climate of Proxima Theta XVIII began to change. The planet began to heat up, and this was unpleasant to the snowpolies. It actually shortened their lifespans by 23%. Because there was no way for the snowpolies to fight back against the Divine Oligarchy, they became rather depressed. This is why the planet is nicknamed <i>Goth, the Black Snow Planet</i>, because to express their depressing moods, the snopolies faded to a blackish color. <br><br></p><br><br><br><a href='SectorMap/Sector 30/Crilanerth-Inderpal Nu XIV/About.html'>Take me back to the star.</a></div>

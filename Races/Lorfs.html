            <p>Lorfs are well known for their specially crafted space-beer. They originate from <a href="SectorMap/Sector 71/XR-46-Vibbagua-Cistea Alpha XIII/Gnayalia Lambada VI/About.html">Gnayalia Lambada VI</a>, and after Libby Mathis, an explorer and food enthusiast came across them, they were accepted as an official race, and they now have bars and pubs all over the galaxy. Lorfs are not only known for their tasty beer, but also for their fermentation gland, an unusual gland that allows them to produce beer through fermentation in their stomachs. Sadly, this gland makes Lorfs a particular target for space-person trafficking. The Galactic Investigation Department has had many cases in which a handful of Lorfs had been kidnapped, held against their will, and used to produce beer that the traffickers would profit off of. </p>

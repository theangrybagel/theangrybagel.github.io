            <p>Photonians are a race of people (almost) completely comprised of light (photons). They are also very sensitive to light that is not of their own wavelength, and because of this, they all live underground in almost complete darkness. Sometime around 432BGF, Photonians began to appear in different wavelengths, which was very painful for other Photonians of different wavelengths. The Photonian government began to segregate photonians based on wavelength, and they are still segregated to this day. </p>

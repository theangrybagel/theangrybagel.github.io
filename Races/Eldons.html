            <p>Known for their age, this race is by far the oldest race in the galaxy, possibly even the universe. 
            Eldons are capable of living millions of years, and remembering just about everything that happens in their life. 
            Due to their long lives, they advanced quicker than any race and may also be the most intelligent lifeform in the galaxy.
            In addition to the results of these long lives, Eldons reproduce once every four <a href="SpaceTerms/Terms.html#GY">GY</a>. 
            The excessive amounts of offspring forced them to migrate to other planets, which is why they control majority of the <a href="/SectorMap/Sector 29/About.html">Eldron Sector (Sector 29)</a>. The Eldons first started their civilization on <a href="SectorMap/Sector 29/RAX-49-Theseus-Thuyowei Gamma XIX/Ubihiri Mu XVI/About.html">Ubirhiri Mu XVI</a>, dating back all the way to 50,000BGF, and they rapidly began to expand outside of <a href="SectorMap/Sector 29/RAX-49-Theseus-Thuyowei Gamma XIX/About.html">Thuyowei Gamma XIX</a> around 12000 AGF. </p>

            Almost every Eldon has this problem, and it causes them to complain far more than what most cultures would consider reasonable.

                Eldons require a very thin atmosphere to breath. When on any space outposts, if you see an Eldon, it's likely that they will have

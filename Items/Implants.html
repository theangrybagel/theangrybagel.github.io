        <p>Many races have certain challenges with adapting to the space life style, often due to unusual climates, enviroments, and other situations. Implants make it easier for these races to adapt with the rest of society.

        <h3>Language Translation Implant (LTI)</h3>
        <p>A permanent implant that can alter brainwaves in order to translate everthing someone sees to a language they understand. This is a necessity for all space people because their are millions of different languages amongst the different places in the galaxy.<i> Note: There is also a device that can be shoved in the ear of some races, which is removeable. These are called LTDs (Language Translation Devices)</i></p>

        <h3>Matelon Eye Implant</h3>
        <p>Matelons don't have eyes. Ok, they do, but their eyes don't reach the outside of their face, making it difficult to see in low light. The MEI is a set of artificial eyes that can amplify light going into the matelon's face/eyes so that they can see in low light.

        <h3>Lorf Beer Station</h3>
        <p>While abused by space people traffickers, the LBS provides a wonderful way for a Lorf to make some money without having to stay in one place. The LBS connects to the Lorf and its stomach, extracting the beer when it is at its optimal fermentation point. The LBS also has a deployable counter with connected bar stools. This thing turns your average Lorf into a walking pub!</p>

        <h3 style='text-align: left;'>Thermal Tracker</h3>
        <p>A visor that can filter and pick up heat signatures, allowing users to find specific things, such as wild animals and other people. </p>

    <div id="LTD">
        <h3 style='text-align: left;'>Language Translation Device (LTD)</h3>
        <p>A very small device that can alter brainwaves in order to translate everthing someone sees to a language they understand. This is a necessity for all space people because their are millions of different languages amongst the different places in the galaxy. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="AtmosphericRadiator">
        <h3 style='text-align: left;'>Atmospheric Radiator</h3>
        <p>A large device worn on the back. This can make surviving on other planets much easier, as it's able to manipulate pressure and tempature within a radius of two feet. </p>

    <div id="CircutScrubber">
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Circut Scrubber</h3>
        <p>A device used to break circuts with the simple press of a button. </p>

    <div id="YIP">
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">YIP</h3>
        <p>A YIP, or a Yolcorg Incubation Pack, developed by <i>Carton Industries</i>, is a small backpack that can be used to incubate a single yolcorg egg. <i>Carton Industries</i> created the YIP-MAX in 12210 AGF, which can hold and incubate up to a dozen yolcorg eggs at once. Beware, the YIP-MAX is well known for producing dead yolcorgs, at least that's what the reviews say.</p>

    <div id="BWRD">
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">BWRD</h3>
        <p>A Brainwave Recieving Device, often used by intergalactic salespeople, that can occasionally pick up the thoughts of a nearby individual. Sadly, intergalactic salespeople do much more thinking than their clients, so the BWRD tends to pick up the salesperson's thoughts instead of the client's thoughts, which is absolutely useless for these salespeople.</p>

    <div id="DistressBeacon">
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Distress Beacon</h3>
        <p>A distress beacon, invented in 1358 AGF, is a way to connect to nearby NIPs and send distress signals. These are handy to have if you're NIP seems to break a lot, and you're ship has broken down in the middle of space. Distress beacons do not connect to SSDCs (due to security protocols), and therefore can be difficult to trace by authorities. Due to this nature, people often use distress beacons to lure in nearby ships and raid them. </p>

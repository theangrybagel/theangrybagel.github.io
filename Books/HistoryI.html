            <h3 class='chapter'><i>Formation of the Galactic Federation</i></h3>
            <p>It is 043 BGF, fourty-three years before the Galactic Federation declared their independence to the rest of the galaxy. Vladimir Koh, the founder of the Federation, has organized a small party consisting of 12000 individuals. Koh was nearly sentenced to death due to treason, but a DO officer and a large bribe can go a long way.</p><p>
                Hudson Yorkston, one of Koh's workers, has just figured out how to travel from one star to another, and only two G-Years later, in 041BGF, Koh, Yorkston, and the rest of the party leave <a href="SectorMap/Sector 69/Velzia-KC-7-Pohl Zeta IX/Brillon Beta XV/About.html">Brillion Xi I</a> and travel to <a href="SectorMap/Sector 79/Dagilia-Abrion Lambada XIII/Luvugawa Nu VI/About.html">Dagilia-Abrion Lambada XIII</a>. They announce their independence, and the Oligarchy is furious, but it takes another 12 G-Years for the Oligarchy to figure out star-to-star space travel.</p>

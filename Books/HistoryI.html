            <h3 class='chapter'><i>Formation of the Galactic Federation</i></h3>
            <p>It is 043 BGF, fourty-three years before the Galactic Federation declared their independence to the rest of the galaxy. Vladimir Koh, the founder of the Federation, has organized a small party consisting of 12000 individuals. Koh was nearly sentenced to death due to treason, but a DO officer and a large bribe can go a long way.</p><p>
                Hudson Yorkston, one of Koh's workers, has just figured out how to travel from one star to another, and only two G-Years later, in 041BGF, Koh, Yorkston, and the rest of the party leave <a href="SectorMap/Sector 69/Velzia-KC-7-Pohl Zeta IX/Brillon Beta XV/About.html">Brillion Xi I</a> and travel to <a href="SectorMap/Sector 79/Dagilia-Abrion Lambada XIII/Luvugawa Nu VI/About.html">Dagilia-Abrion Lambada XIII</a>. They announce their independence, and the Oligarchy is furious, but it takes another 12 G-Years for the Oligarchy to figure out star-to-star space travel.</p>

            <h3 class='chapter'><i>Technological Advancements</i></h3>
            <p>
                In 703AGF, the Divine Oligarchy developed the first automines in the galaxy, the helium automines of <a href="SectorMap/Sector 79/Dagilia-BZ-47-Disioyama Iota XV/Pethea Xi XI/About.html">Pethea Xi XI</a>. 34,900 years later, Vatoya Rudkin, a spy for the Galactic Federation, discovered the automines of Pethea Xi, and after 17 years of planning, the Galactic Federation launched an attack on this planet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Pethea Xi is one of very few helium gas giants in the galaxy, which is why it has been a common target the past several years by all major factions. As of 50000AGF, it's owned by the Torgian military. The automines started an industrial trend of taking over gas giants and building mines on these planets. As of now, the most heavily guarded automines in the galaxy are those of ACX-48.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the various wars over Pethea Xi, an arms race began. It was mostly between the Galactic Federation and the Divine Oligarchy, however some others were involved. George Blois, a scientist working for the Divine Oligarchy Weapons and Research Institution (DOWRI), had created Serkium-1218K, a chemical compound much like Serkium, a commonly used compound for plasma based weapons, only when energized, 25 grams of the stuff could of creating an explosion capable of destroying anything within 13 feet from it. In 39202AGF, the Divine Oligarchy Military attacked the Galactic Federation with their new superweapon: The Bloiserk-1218. They attacked <a href="SectorMap/Sector 69/FCP-29-Vixia-KPX-37-Treigantu Eta V/Eka Epsilon XI/About.html">Eka Epsilon XI</a>, one of the Galactic Federation's planets, dedicated mostly to weapons research and testing. The explosion brought the planet's temperature up by 120 degrees.

            <h3 class='chapter'><i>The Beginning</i></h3>
            <p>A long time ago, in this very, small, uninhabited galaxy, a ruler was born. It wasn’t just born — it was secreted from the nostrils of a massive space whale, for absolutely no reason. This ruler had a mind like no other, for there were no other minds. Using its incredibly powerful mind, it invented life. It’s impossible to know what happened between the creation of ROTU, it’s creation of life, and the start of civilization. It is probable, however, that nothing happened between this time, because before civilization, there was only ROTU, because anything that wasn’t documented in history clearly never happened. That’s how the universe works, right?</p>
            <h3 class='chapter'><i>About the Space Whale</i></h3>
            <p>Space whales exist. They've always existed. The one that decided to let the ruler of the universe out of it's nostrils was a rather massive space whale. His name was Bob. Bob was living a peaceful life until his brain began to break down. Small bits of his brain, as well as small bits of his consciousness, left him. They left him and entered his nose, where they combined to form ROTU. So much of Bob's brain had left him that 92% of his brain, along with his consciousness, was now ROTU. At this point, ROTU was too large for Bob's nostrils, and because of the anatomy of a space whale, ROTU could not go further up Bob's nostrils, so ROTU was secreted out the exterior entrances of Bob's nostrils. </p>

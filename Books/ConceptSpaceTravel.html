            <p>Space is fundamental to the universe. We can move, because of space. We can see, because of space. We can do things, because of <i>space</i>. In this book, I will, as you can probably already tell, be explaining space.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter"><i>Communicating space</i></h3>
            <p>Space can be difficult to explain if there aren't any points of reference. I have invented several forms of measurement - Yorks. A fun fact for you bored readers out there - I determined the size of a York by calculating how far my body would stretch if it were ripped apart, atom by atom, in a very large black hole, and each atom was placed in a long line. Anyways, back onto Yorks. They're a measurement of distance, best used to describe the distance between to objects in space. Then, there are microyorks. These represent one millionth of a York. </p>

            <h3 class='chapter'><i>What is Space?</i></h3>
            <p>Space is fundamental to the universe. We can move, because of space. We can see, because of space. We can do things, because of <i>space</i>. In this book, I will, as you can probably already tell, be explaining space.</p>
            <p>Space, is everything around you. Technically, you're always in space, but what most people consider being in space is actually being far away from any large objects with gravitational force. If you are reading this on a planet, you are on something that is in space This makes it culturally incorrect to say that you are in space. If you're reading this in space, then someone must have sent you out their airlock, and I must say I'm flattered that this would be the last book you decide to read before dying in the vaccum of space.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter"><i>Communicating Space Things</i></h3>
            <p>Space can be difficult to explain if there aren't any points of reference. I have invented several forms of measurement - Yorks. A fun fact for you bored readers out there - I determined the size of a York by calculating how far my body would stretch if it were ripped apart, atom by atom, in a very large black hole, and each atom was placed in a long line. I may or may not have used real world experiementation with a few volunteers with the same mass as me to perform this calculation. Anyways, back onto Yorks. They're a measurement of distance, best used to describe the distance between to objects in space. Then, there are Microyorks. These represent one millionth of a York. A Nanoyork, or NY, represents one billionth of a York, or one thousandth of a Microyork. Now, let's move on to how space travel actually works. </p>
            <h3 class="chapter"><i>Spaceship Thrusters</i></h3>
            <p>The way a spaceship works is quite interesting. Every spaceship, if it is functioning, has an engine, as well as a set of thrusters. The engine converts fuel into some form of energy, which is then transfered to the thrusters, which then propel the spaceship through space. In most spaceships, there are at least three sets of thrusters: low level thrusters, high level thrusters, and guidance thrusters.</p><p>Low level thrusters use low level fuel, and they use planetary propulsion to provide the spaceship with momentum. If you're a space-idiot, you probably don't know what planetary propulsion is. If you're a space-idiot, you should give up on trying to educate yourself on complicated topics such as this and focus on something more simple, such as cooking a yolcorg egg on a plasma-stove. Simply because of how unintelligible you must be, you probably won't do what I say, so I'll go ahead and incorporate an explanation on planetary propulsion <i>in another chapter</i>. These low level thrusters are generally used when the spaceship is within close proximity to a planet. High level thrusters use <i>spacedust propulsion</i> to fly through the vast emptiness of space. They are most effective when near a planet, for their powerful force against such a great mass can get the spaceship travelling at near-light speed. </p>
            <p>The third set of thrusters, the guidance thrusters, are generally used to maneuver the ship and rotate it to face a desired direction. These thrusters are essential on small combat fighters, since they are the key to aiming and dodging attacks. Most standard ships come equipped with eight different guidance thrusters, while combat fighters generally come with 12-24 of them. In space, high level fuel can be redirected into the guidance thrusters, allowing them to propell the ship with the same force as a high level thruster.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter"><i>Propulsion Methods</i></h3>
            <p>Planetary Propulsion is when a ship's thrusters output a great deed of force, which then accelerates the ship when that wave of force hits part of a planet or some other large space object. </p>
            <p>High level thrusters use a very powerful computer that can determine where the greatest heaps of spacedust lie within proximity to their ship. The thrusters aim towards these areas when outputting their force to maintain maximum speed. This is called spacedust propulsion. </p>
            <h3 class="chapter"><i>The Jump Map Navigation Network</i></h3>
            <p>I didn't invent any of the complex navigation systems, that was all designed by Delisa Durand, a colleague of mine, who was the one to document the first case of Eldon Foot Fungus, as well as the first to die from it. The system she designed was titled the Jump Map Navigation Network <i>(JMNN)</i>. The JMNN relies on a vast network of <i>jump wheels</i>, giant rings used by spaceships to warp from one solar system to the next. Each jump wheel holds a Solar System Data Container (SSDC), a massive server containing data for that solar system, such as the planets of that system, recent major events regarding politics and territorial control, and prices to use the jump wheel. In many cases, the SSDC will have their own media network, as well as their own social media network, along with a large community of space people who either regularly visit the solar system or just so happen to live there. </p>
            <p>Every spaceship is equipped with a Navigation Interface Panel <i>(NIP)</i>, which allows the pilot to navigate their way through space. Most NIPs are nearly indestructible, as to prevent failiure, since if the NIP fails, the pilot has no way of navigating through space. Each NIP allow pilots to connect to desired SSDCs, and if something goes wrong, the pilot can send a distress signal to all nearby SSDCs. </p>

            <h3 class='chapter'><i>Space</i></h3>
            <p>Space is fundamental to the universe. We can move, because of space. We can see, because of space. We can do things, because of <i>space</i>. In this book, I will, as you can probably already tell, be explaining space.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter"><i>Communicating Space Things</i></h3>
            <p>Space can be difficult to explain if there aren't any points of reference. I have invented several forms of measurement - Yorks. A fun fact for you bored readers out there - I determined the size of a York by calculating how far my body would stretch if it were ripped apart, atom by atom, in a very large black hole, and each atom was placed in a long line. Anyways, back onto Yorks. They're a measurement of distance, best used to describe the distance between to objects in space. Then, there are Microyorks. These represent one millionth of a York. A Nanoyork, or NY, represents one billionth of a York, or one thousandth of a Microyork. Now, let's move on to how space travel actually works. </p>
            <h3 class="chapter"><i>Space Stuff</i></h3>
            <p>The way a spaceship works is quite interesting. Every spaceship, if it is functioning, has an engine, as well as thrusters. The engine converts fuel into energy, which is then transfered to the thrusters, which propel the spaceship through space. In most spaceships, there are at least two sets of thrusters: low level thrusters, and high level thrusters.</p><p>Low level thrusters use low level fuel, and they use planetary propulsion to provide the spaceship with momentum. If you're a space-idiot, you probably don't know what planetary propulsion is. If you're a space-idiot, you should give up on trying to educate yourself on complicated topics such as this and focus on something more simple, such as cooking a yolcorg egg on a plasma-stove. Just because of how unintelligible you are, you probably won't do what I say, so I'll go ahead and incorporate an explanation on planetary propulsion.</p>
            <p>Planetary Propulsion is when a ships thrusters output a great deed of force, which then accelerates the ship when that wave of force hits part of a planet. </p>
            <p>High level thrusters use a very powerful processor that can determine where the greatest heaps of spacedust lie within proximity to their ship. The thrusters aim towards these areas when outputting their force to maintain maximum speed. This is called spacedust propulsion. </p>

            <p>STARTING LOCATION - The common grounds of <a href="SectorMap/Sector 71/KFP-48-Etis-FBF-11-Dainerth Delta II/Linzioclite Iota X/About.html">Linzioclite Iota X</a></p>
            <p>The crew sees a Matelon staring at them from a distance (try to convince party that this is who they need to talk to)</p>
            <p>TALK TO MATELON - The Matelon introduces themselves as Alon Locksley, head of the Matelon Terrorist organization in Sector 71. He asks the crew if they'd like a job (the crew should say yes to this, it's the only way to continue the campaign.)</p>
            <p>JOB DESCRIPTION - There's a plutonium automine just a few jumps from here over in Sector 39. We are going to raid it. (intel. check > 7 - player knows the location as the automines of ACX-48, one of the most heavilly guarded automines in the galaxy, which would be very dangerous to raid.) All I need you to do is to provide additional support and infiltrate the cargo bay, where we'll be waiting for you with a CG-12 (intel. check > 5 - a CG-12 is a medium cargo ship with over 200 units of storage). </p>
            <p>(If the crew declines the job offer, one option would be to have Matelon terrorists hunt down the crew due and attempt to murder them to their knowledge of the raid.)</p>
            <p>CREW ACCEPTS MISSION - Ideal objective - head to ACX-48. (If the crew has no ship, they could buy a small ship from one of the ship merchants located somewhere in the common grounds.) </p>
            <p>ARRIVED AT ACX-48 - Ideal option would be to get the ship to the guest docking hub, then go to the cargo bay area. The main halls are very long, but they've got railcars that can make going through the halls much faster. In order to get into the main hall from the guest enterance, the crew will need to get past the two guards guarding the door to the main hall. There are bathrooms in the guest enterance room, and yes, there are air vents, which require a small character to climb through (they're located near the floors). </p>
            <p>ENTER MAIN HALL - If the crew took out the two guards, chances are someone pulled the alarm (1D6 > 3 - alarm goes off). If the alarm was pulled, guards will begin flooding the main halls. Otherwise, the next pair of guards are at the enterance to the cargo bay. The crew can take a railcar to get to the cargo bay area</p>
            <p>ARRIVE AT CARGO BAY - Two guards at the main enterance, and the doors may be locked (D6 > 2 - doors locked). One of the guards has explosives on them, which can be used to blast the doors down if they're locked. Another option would be to wait for a worker to walk through the doors. </p>
            <p>ENTER CARGO BAY - There are 8 guards in the area. The keypad used to open the cargo bay doors is marked in green. The guards are marked as red. Once the guards have been taken out, and the doors have opened, the cargo ship docks itself in the cargo bay. Several Matelon terrorists exit the ship, and begin to load crates of processed plutonium. </p>
            <p>PLUTONIUM HAS BEEN LOADED ONTO THE SHIP - The ship begins to take off, and the Matelon terrorists leave without the crew. <i>The Matelons have basically betrayed the crew, and they don't intend to pay up.</i> The crew can either go after them or do nothing, but it's reccommended that they track down the terrorists since they've got hundreds of thousands worth of credits in processed plutonium.</p>

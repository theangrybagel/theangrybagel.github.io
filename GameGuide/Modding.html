            <p>Mods for WPLTS are not very customizable. The only things you can really do are add new weapons, ships, armor, and other simple items, as well as modify AI and stuff. </p>
            <h2>The File Structure</h2>
            <p>All the files used for game data are located in your games folder /StreamingAssets/Data. </p>
            <h3>Presets</h3>
            <p>The presets file contains several other folders, and in each of these folders exists xml files with data used when accessing presets. Item presets consist of a list of ItemData, and they are located in Data/Presets/Items. AI presets consist of a list of AIData, and they are located in Data/Presets/AI. </p>
            <h3>Sprite Creation</h3>
            <p>When the prototype-beta comes out, many features will not be in effect, including the sprite tool. There will, when the 2D game is released, be a sprite tool to transform sprites and spritesheets into XML files. (This will allow custom items to have custom sprites)</p>

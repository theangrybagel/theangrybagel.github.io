            <h3>Stat/Skill Checks</h3>
            <p>This is explained <a href="RPGMechanics/Skills.html">here</a>, but here's a brief explaination on it: A skill or stat check is when the game master (GM) needs to make an "unbiased" decision on what should happen to a player. Generally, the GM will find a way to determine a minimum value the player needs to roll in order to succeed in their action. Then, the GM has the player roll a D20 and add appropriate values (like values from the player's skills or stats) to whatever they roll, and then compare the minimum value to the value the player rolled to determine the outcome of the action. If this still doesn't make sense to you, do some googling on how TTRPGs work. </p> 
            <h3>Rolling</h3>
            <p>Custom rolls in this guide are represented with R and another number. R15, R9, R32, and R300 are all examples of custom rolls. Other rolls will be represented with a number (optional) and a type of die. Examples of these are D10, D20, 2D6, 3D20. </p>
            <h4>Regular Dice</h4>
            <p>To roll for something that uses a regular dice, such as a D20, or a 2D6, simply get out that kind of die and roll it. If there is a number in front of the dice indicator, such as 2D6, roll multiple times (as many times as the number shows) and add each roll to get your final result.</p>
            <h4>Custom Rolls</h4>
            <p>Custom rolls, represented with R along with another number, are used mostly when calculating things like damage. To get the value for a custom roll, roll 2D10s to get a value from 1-100. Next, divide that value by 100. Finally, multiply it by the number after the R. If the number after the R is 23, and we roll 74, the final value is (74/100) * 23, which is about 17. Be sure to round to the nearest integer.

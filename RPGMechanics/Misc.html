            <h3>Rolling</h3>
            <p>Custom rolls in this guide are represented with R and another number. R15, R9, R32, and R300 are all examples of custom rolls. Other rolls will be represented with a number (optional) and a type of die. Examples of these are D10, D20, 2D6, 3D20. </p>
            <h4>Regular Dice</h4>
            <p>To roll for something that uses a regular dice, such as a D20, or a 2D6, simply get out that kind of die and roll it. If there is a number in front of the dice indicator, such as 2D6, roll multiple times (as many times as the number shows) and add each roll to get your final result.</p>
            <h4>Custom Rolls</h4>
            <p>Custom rolls, represented with R along with another number, are used mostly when calculating things like damage. To get the value for a custom roll, roll 2D10s to get a value from 1-100. Next, divide that value by 100. Finally, multiply it by the number after the R. If the number after the R is 23, and we roll 74, the final value is (74/100) * 23, which is about 17. Be sure to round to the nearest integer.

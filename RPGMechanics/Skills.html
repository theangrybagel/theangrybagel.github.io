        <p>Most of a player's skills will usually be set to 0. If a player wants their character to specialize in something, increasing a skill that can be linked to their character is ideal. Some skills are boosted by a character's stats. The following is a list of all the skills in WPLTS, and descriptions of how they are used. If a skill is boosted by a stat, this will be noted in the description. There will be a number in parentheses, which represents the number to subtract from the players stat when adding it to a skill. If a players Small Weapons base (by base, I mean without any modifications) skill is 3, and the boost is dexterity(5), and their dexterity is 8, the calculated value of this skill will be 3 + (8-5), which is 6. If their dexterity happened to be less than five, such as 4, then the skill would be 3 + (4-5), which is 2. If there are two or more stat boosts to a skill, add the modifiers together and use the average/mean of those modifiers when calculating the value of a skill. If there is an M after the stat boost, such as Agility(5)M, negate any negative values when calculating. </p>

        <h2>How to use skill checks for undocumented actions</h2>
        <p>After calculating the final value of a skill, you'll probably want to know what to do with that value. Have the player roll a D20, and add their skill value to that number. Then, you, the game master, roll a D20. If the player rolled higher than you, then their action succeeds. Common sense can be used from here to figure out the outcome of their action.

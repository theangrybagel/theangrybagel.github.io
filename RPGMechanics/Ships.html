            <p>Spaceships are a big part of WPLTS. Players can customize their ship if they wish, adding different components that change the way their spaceship works. Each ship model will have a list of supported components, as well as certain specifications for those components. Below is a list of all the ship components a player can modify.</p>

            <h2>Calculating Ship Speed and Fuel Intake</h2>
            <p>Ship speed is calculated by taking the speed of the thrusters in use, and adding the speeds together. The fuel intake is calculated by adding the fuel intakes of all the thrusters in use together. </p>

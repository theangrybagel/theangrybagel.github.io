            <p>NPCs (Non Player Characters) are a bit different from player characters. They require less information, but they can be a hassle to create. (An NPC generator is on its way, don't worry.)</p>
            <p>The following lists the basic requirements for any NPC.</p>
            <div>
                <h3>Stats</h3>
                <p>Stats are generated the same way as you would generate a players stats. </p>
                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <p>Skills are up to the GM, however it is reccommended you give the NPC a class and refer to classes for skill generation. </p>
                <h3>Equipment</h3>
                <p>This is optional, but in most cases NPCs should have a weapon and some money. </p>

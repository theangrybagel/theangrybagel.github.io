            <h3>Calculating Base Damage</h3>
            <p>To calculate base damage, add the weapons damage value and modifiers associated to that weapon type. If there are multiple types for a weapon, add all of the modifiers for each of the types (discard duplicate modififiers). If the target has armor, subtract the total defense of their armor from the base damage. </p>
            <table class="tableMain">
                <tr>
                    <td>Weapon Type</td>
                    <td>Modifiers (skills)</td>
                </tr>

            <h3>Calculating Hits/Misses</h3>
            <p>To calculate whether or not an action misses, consult the following instructions:<br>
                If the range of the weapon is less than the distance between the attacker and the target, the attack misses. Otherwise, continue. Roll a D20 and add the attackers dexterity stat to that, and then roll a D20 and add the targets agility stat (as well as their dodging skill) to that. If the attacker has a higher number than the target, the attack hits. If it's a tie, the defender takes only a fourth of the damage. If the attacker rolls lower than the target, the attack misses.
            </p>

                    <td>If D6 < p, and body damage is done (as in damage to the target and just the armor), and the damage is greater than 3, the target now bleeds for <i>p</i> amount of turns, losing D6 health per turn.</td>

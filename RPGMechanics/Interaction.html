            <h2>Interacting with people and reputation</h2>
            <p>Every NPC, once interacted with, should be logged in the player's People + Missions spot (if that player has a chance to see them again), and the player should note their reputation value with that NPC. Most reputation values start at zero, but it depends on the NPC. Reputation values are used when doing charisma checks against an NPC. Simply add the reputation value to whatever the the player rolls when doing a check. </p>
